# in the diversifying transformation, BB_XX label is inserted to the beginning
# of certain instructions. However, as they are inserted in front of function
# label, function label would not be assembled into binary. For example:
#
# BB_xxx:
# S_0xxxx:  -> this is a function name
# mov ...
#
# after assembling and disassembing on the unstripped binary, only BB_xxx can
# be found
#
# <BB_xxx>:
# mov ...
#
# we want to keep the function label instead of BB label, so let's adjust it in
# this way
# S_0xxxx:
# BB_xxx:
# mov ...
